# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the current Tauri-based image viewer application from a technical-driven file structure to a feature-driven architecture. The goal is to improve code organization, maintainability, and scalability by grouping related functionality together rather than separating by technical concerns. The refactoring must be done incrementally with continuous testing to ensure no functionality is broken during the transition.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase organized by features rather than technical layers, so that related functionality is co-located and easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the src directory THEN the system SHALL organize code by feature domains (image-viewer, folder-navigation, settings, etc.) rather than technical layers (components, hooks, services)
2. WHEN a feature is modified THEN the system SHALL have all related code (components, hooks, services, types) in the same feature directory
3. WHEN adding new functionality THEN the system SHALL follow the feature-driven structure consistently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain all existing functionality during the refactoring, so that the application continues to work correctly throughout the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring is performed THEN the system SHALL maintain all current image viewing capabilities
2. WHEN refactoring is performed THEN the system SHALL maintain all current folder navigation functionality
3. WHEN refactoring is performed THEN the system SHALL maintain all current UI interactions and behaviors
4. WHEN each refactoring step is completed THEN the system SHALL pass all existing tests
5. WHEN each refactoring step is completed THEN the system SHALL build without errors
6. WHEN each refactoring step is completed THEN the system SHALL pass linting checks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactoring to be done incrementally with validation at each step, so that issues can be caught and resolved early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a refactoring step is completed THEN the system SHALL run build, lint, and test commands to validate the changes
2. WHEN errors are detected THEN the system SHALL resolve all issues before proceeding to the next step
3. WHEN moving files THEN the system SHALL update all import statements to maintain correct references
4. WHEN refactoring is performed THEN the system SHALL maintain proper TypeScript type safety throughout

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear feature boundaries and shared utilities properly organized, so that code reuse is optimized and dependencies are clear.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing features THEN the system SHALL identify and separate shared utilities from feature-specific code
2. WHEN organizing features THEN the system SHALL create a shared directory for common components, hooks, and utilities
3. WHEN organizing features THEN the system SHALL ensure each feature has clear boundaries and minimal coupling
4. WHEN organizing features THEN the system SHALL maintain proper separation between UI components and business logic

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new structure to support the existing Tauri architecture and development workflow, so that the refactoring doesn't disrupt the current development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring is completed THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing Tauri commands and APIs
2. WHEN refactoring is completed THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing build processes (pnpm dev, pnpm build)
3. WHEN refactoring is completed THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing debugging configurations in launch.json and tasks.json
4. WHEN refactoring is completed THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing Storybook configuration
5. WHEN refactoring is completed THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing test configurations and runners
