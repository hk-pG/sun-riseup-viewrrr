# Requirements Document

## Introduction

このspecは、sun-riseup-viewrrrアプリケーションを最新の技術スタックにアップグレードし、現在の煩雑な設定状況を改善することを目的としています。React 19への対応、Tailwind CSS v4への移行、shadcn/uiによる統一されたテーマ設定システムの構築により、開発体験の向上と保守性の改善を実現します。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upgrade to React 19, so that I can benefit from the latest performance improvements and features while maintaining application stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React 19 is installed THEN all existing components SHALL continue to function without breaking changes
2. WHEN React 19 features are available THEN the application SHALL utilize new performance optimizations
3. WHEN TypeScript types are updated THEN they SHALL be compatible with React 19 APIs
4. WHEN the upgrade is complete THEN all tests SHALL pass without modification
5. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN they SHALL be compatible with React 19

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate to Tailwind CSS v4, so that I can use the latest features and improved performance while simplifying configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Tailwind CSS v4 is installed THEN all existing styles SHALL render correctly
2. WHEN the new configuration format is applied THEN it SHALL be simpler and more maintainable than the current setup
3. WHEN CSS compilation occurs THEN it SHALL be faster than the previous version
4. WHEN custom utilities are defined THEN they SHALL work with the new architecture
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN no visual regressions SHALL occur

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified theme system using shadcn/ui, so that I can easily manage dark mode, light mode, and custom themes without complex configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the theme system is initialized THEN it SHALL support light and dark modes out of the box
2. WHEN users switch themes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and immediate across all components
3. WHEN custom theme colors are defined THEN they SHALL be consistently applied throughout the application
4. WHEN shadcn/ui components are used THEN they SHALL automatically inherit the current theme
5. WHEN theme preferences are set THEN they SHALL persist across application restarts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want streamlined development tool configuration, so that I can focus on feature development rather than tooling setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN development tools are configured THEN they SHALL work together without conflicts
2. WHEN linting runs THEN it SHALL use consistent rules across all file types
3. WHEN formatting is applied THEN it SHALL maintain consistent code style
4. WHEN type checking occurs THEN it SHALL provide accurate feedback with React 19 types
5. WHEN the development server starts THEN all tools SHALL be properly integrated

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic dependency management, so that I can easily keep packages up to date without breaking changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN package updates are available THEN the system SHALL identify compatible versions
2. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN breaking changes SHALL be detected and reported
3. WHEN security vulnerabilities exist THEN they SHALL be automatically identified and resolved
4. WHEN peer dependencies conflict THEN clear resolution steps SHALL be provided
5. WHEN the update process runs THEN it SHALL maintain application functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved build and development performance, so that I can iterate faster during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development server starts THEN it SHALL be faster than the current setup
2. WHEN files are changed THEN hot reload SHALL be immediate and reliable
3. WHEN the application is built THEN build time SHALL be optimized
4. WHEN assets are processed THEN they SHALL be efficiently bundled
5. WHEN TypeScript compilation occurs THEN it SHALL be faster with better caching

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consolidated configuration files, so that I can manage project settings from a centralized location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration files are organized THEN they SHALL follow modern best practices
2. WHEN settings are changed THEN they SHALL be applied consistently across all tools
3. WHEN new developers join THEN setup SHALL be straightforward with minimal configuration
4. WHEN environment-specific settings are needed THEN they SHALL be easily manageable
5. WHEN configuration conflicts arise THEN they SHALL be automatically detected and resolved

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless Tauri integration with the modern stack, so that desktop functionality works optimally with the updated frontend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Tauri builds the application THEN it SHALL work seamlessly with React 19
2. WHEN Tailwind CSS v4 styles are compiled THEN they SHALL be properly included in Tauri builds
3. WHEN theme switching occurs THEN it SHALL work correctly in the desktop environment
4. WHEN development and production builds are created THEN they SHALL maintain consistent behavior
5. WHEN Tauri APIs are used THEN they SHALL integrate properly with the modern React patterns
