# Implementation Plan

## Git Workflow Guidelines

- Create feature branch for each major task group: `feature/react-19-upgrade`, `feature/theme-system`, etc.
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages following conventional commits format
- Run tests and linting before each commit
- Create pull requests for code review before merging to main branch

## Validation Steps for Each Task

- Run `pnpm build` to ensure no build errors
- Run `pnpm test` to verify all existing tests pass
- Run `pnpm lint` to ensure code quality standards
- Test application functionality manually when applicable
